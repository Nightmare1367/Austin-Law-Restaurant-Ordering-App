Austin Law - Restaurant Ordering App

My program is a restaurant ordering app that allows customers to order at a specific restaurant. This would mean that the program is designed for one restaurant.
How the program would work from a customer perspective is that they are introduced to a welcome page which gives them a brief introduction on how to get started
and once get into the actual menu where the items are displayed, they have the option to switch between pages, open description pages for specific items, add
or remove items from their order and lastly, be able to place an order. The description page would contain an image of the dish, the name and a description 
that includes an about the dish and the ingredients used in the dish. When the customer places an order, a receipt containing the day and time they placed the 
order as well as the order and the total price of the order. This order can be accessed from a .txt file under the customers order ID which can be found in the 
top right corner of the program.

The programming language used in the code is Python and uses CustomTkinter for the aesthetics of the program.

You would want to make sure that you have CustomTkinter and Pillow installed before running the program.
The installation process for CustomTkinter is as follows;
Typing "pip3 install customtkinter" in your command prompt as an administrator

The installation process for Pillow is as follows;
Typing "pip install --upgrade pip" and "pip install --upgrade Pillow" in your command prompt as an administrator
